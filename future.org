  ideas for future features of breezefield
  THESE ARE IDEAS AND ARE NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
  I also do not guarantee to ever get around to all of them (but feel free to contribute yourself, even if it's just a note of an idea!)
** make it possible to use either love.physics or HC as a backend 
   (is this worth it?)
*** implement some 'translation' of love.physics commands to HC and vice versa
** add features for filtering collisions
*** idea 1: set which colliders to ignore/collide
**** collider:setCollides(colliders)
**** collider:setIgnores(colliders)
**** collider:getIgnores()
**** collider:getCollides()
**** collider:clearCollides() -- reset to default
**** define identity to some value (e.g. table used to generate instances)
***** if specific table is not set to ignore or collides, check if _collider_class is set to Ignore
*** idea 2: interface to setFilterData/setMask/setCategory/setGroupIndex
**** wrap them to accept list of integers, converting to 16 bit int and passing through
*** idea 3:
**** something to allow :enter :exit to work even without physics collisions
**** idea 1 with collider:setCallCollision(colliders) ... ?
